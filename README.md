## Project Title:
**Book Finder and Quote Generator Web App**

## Project Description:
This project involves creating a simple web application that allows users to search for books and generate random quotes. The application will integrate with two server-side APIs: one for book search and the other for quote generation. The user interface will be styled using the Bulma CSS framework to ensure a clean and responsive design.

## User Story:
- **As a book enthusiast,**
  - I want to search for books by title, author, or genre,
  - So that I can easily discover new books to read.
- **As a user looking for inspiration,**
  - I want to generate random quotes,
  - So that I can find motivation or share them with others.

## Mockup:
The design will include a search bar for books, a results section displaying book information, and a separate section for generating and displaying random quotes. The layout will be simple and intuitive, making use of Bulmaâ€™s grid system and components.

## Application Requirements:
- Uses at least 2 server-side APIs:
  1. Book Search API (e.g., Google Books API)
  2. Quote Generator API (e.g., Quotes API)
- CSS framework: Bulma

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1. **API Integration:**
   - Research and select appropriate APIs for book search and quote generation.
   - Set up API requests to fetch data for book search and quote generation.
2. **Frontend Development:**
   - Design the layout using tailwind, ensuring a responsive and clean interface.
   - Implement the search functionality, displaying results dynamically.
   - Implement the quote generation feature, displaying a new quote on request.
3. **Backend Development:**
   - Set up server-side logic to handle API requests and responses.
   - Integrate APIs with the frontend for seamless data flow.
4. **Testing:**
   - Test the app for functionality, ensuring that book searches and quote generation work as expected.
   - Ensure that the app is responsive and visually appealing across different devices.
5. **Deployment:**
   - Prepare the app for deployment, ensuring all dependencies are correctly configured.
   - Deploy the app to a hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Heroku).
6. **Documentation:**
   - Write documentation for setting up and using the app, including API keys configuration if needed.
   - Document any challenges encountered during development and how they were resolved.
